### Object and Class — The Foundation of OOP

    ✅ Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods.
    🇺🇿 Class: Ob'ektlarni yaratish uchun shablon. U xususiyatlar va metodlarni belgilaydi.

    ✅ Why do we need classes?
    🇺🇿 Nima uchun class kerak?

### Constructor and Properties

    ✅ Constructor: A special method that runs when an object is created.
    🇺🇿 Constructor: Ob'ekt yaratilganda avtomatik ravishda ishga tushadigan maxsus metod.

    ✅ this keyword: Refers to the current object instance inside the class.
    🇺🇿 this kalit so‘zi: Class ichidagi joriy ob'ektga murojaat qiladi.

    ✅ Public and Private properties: Class properties can be set to public or private.
    🇺🇿 Public va Private xususiyatlar: Class xususiyatlari public (hamma uchun ochiq) yoki private (faqat class ichida) bo‘lishi mumkin.

### Methods (Actions within Classes)

    ✅ Methods: Functions within a class, used to define actions for objects.
    🇺🇿 Methods: Class ichidagi funksiyalar bo‘lib, ob'ektlar uchun harakatlarni belgilaydi.

    ✅ Accessing methods with this: Referring to the current object.
    🇺🇿 this yordamida metodlarga murojaat qilish: Joriy ob'ektga murojaat qilish.

    ✅ Methods for accessing data: External data manipulation should only happen via methods.
    🇺🇿 Ma'lumotlarga kirish uchun metodlar: Tashqi ma'lumotlarni faqat metodlar orqali o‘zgartirish kerak.

### Inheritance

    ✅ Inheritance: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
    🇺🇿 Inheritance (Meros olish): Bitta class boshqa classdan xususiyatlar va metodlarni meros oladi.

    ✅ extends keyword: Used to create a subclass.

    ✅ Overriding methods: Subclass can modify or override methods of the parent class.
    🇺🇿 Metodlarni override qilish: Subclass parent class metodlarini o‘zgartirishi yoki qayta yozishi mumkin.

### Polymorphism

    ✅ Polymorphism: Methods that can take multiple forms, based on the class context.
    🇺🇿 Polymorphism (Ko‘p shakllilik): Metodlar turli shakllarda ishlashi mumkin, class kontekstiga qarab.

    ✅ Method Overriding: A subclass can change a parent class method’s behavior.
    🇺🇿 Metodlarni Override qilish: Subclass parent class metodining ish faoliyatini o‘zgartirishi mumkin.

### Abstraction

    ✅ Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features.
    🇺🇿 Abstraktsiya: Keraksiz tafsilotlarni yashirish va faqat asosiy xususiyatlarni ochib berish.

    ✅ Abstract class: A class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited.
    🇺🇿 Abstract class: Yaratib bo‘lmaydigan va meros olish uchun mo‘ljallangan class.

    ✅ Interfaces: Define a contract for classes without providing implementation.
    🇺🇿 Interface: Classlar uchun implementatsiya taqdim etmasdan shartnoma belgilash.

### Access Modifiers: public, private, protected

    ✅ public: Accessible from anywhere.
    🇺🇿 public: Hamma joydan kirish mumkin.

    ✅ private: Only accessible within the class.
    🇺🇿 private: Faqat class ichidan kirish mumkin.

    ✅ protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
    🇺🇿 protected: Class va uning subclasslari ichidan kirish mumkin.

### Static Methods & Properties

    ✅ Static methods/properties: Belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class.
    🇺🇿 Static metodlar/xususiyatlar: Classga tegishli bo‘lib, classning instansiyalariga emas.

    ✅ static keyword: Used to define static methods and properties.
    🇺🇿 static kalit so‘zi: Static metodlar va xususiyatlarni aniqlash uchun ishlatiladi.
